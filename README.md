# Daily Weather Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing daily weather data to understand patterns and trends. It involves data cleaning, exploration, visualization, statistical analysis, and model building using a small dataset of daily weather information.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes daily weather information such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed. You can find similar datasets on websites like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) or the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

## Project Steps

### 1. Dataset Selection
- Choose a suitable dataset from the aforementioned sources.
- Ensure it contains relevant weather variables.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Inspect the dataset for missing values and outliers.
- Handle missing values through imputation or other appropriate methods.
- Remove or correct any outliers.

### 3. Data Exploration
- Perform descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
- Use metrics like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Create visualizations to understand data distributions and identify patterns.
- Use tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn in Python.
- Common visualizations include histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and line graphs.

### 5. Statistical Analysis
- Apply statistical tests to identify relationships between variables.
- Conduct correlation analysis to find correlations between temperature, precipitation, and other variables.
- Consider time series analysis for datasets covering extended periods.

### 6. Model Building
- Build predictive models to forecast weather patterns.
- Use machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
- Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- Assess the model's accuracy using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

## Outcome
- A comprehensive analysis of the daily weather data.
- Visualizations and statistical insights.
- Predictive models for forecasting future weather conditions based on historical data.
